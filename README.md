## Inspiration

Playing Melee is often full of key-smashing. Each character has special skills that should be taken advantage of. But its easy to forget all the differences between the 26 different characters. So we wanted to create a hands free app to accompany your playtime to bring come logic to the chaos. 
## What it does
Before you start your game, turn on your application and select your characters. Just shout out the selection you made and it will tell you aloud one of the best combo moves to use on that character. Even if you forget later on in the match, don't worry! Just call out the name of your character and it will remind you all that precious info again to crush your opponents. 

## How we built it
This application was developed for Android using Android Studio. We used the native voice to text API for Android to recognize when someone calls for help on a character by name.
